Integration of the 747 API with an E-Wallet WebApp

The integration of the 747 CasinoBridge API into an e-wallet web app involves multiple processes including user authentication, balance management, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction tracking. Below is a comprehensive guide to integrating the API effectively.

⸻

1. Overview of 747 API Integration

Key API Endpoints

The 747 API provides multiple functionalities for managing user transactions, including:
	•	Account Balances: /account/get-balances
	•	Cryptocurrency Deposit Address Generation: /payments/generate-cryptapi-address
	•	Fiat and Crypto Withdrawals: /payments/withdraw
	•	Fund Transfers: /Default/Transfer
	•	Transaction History & Statistics: /statistics/transactions-by-client-username
	•	User Authentication & Hierarchy: /Default/GetHierarchy
	•	Messaging & Notifications: /Default/SendMessage

⸻

2. Integration Flow & Logic

The e-wallet system will interact with the 747 API for the following operations:

Step 1: User Authentication & Account Hierarchy Retrieval
	•	Authenticate users by fetching their details via:

GET /Default/GetHierarchy?username={username}&isAgent={true/false}


	•	Store and map their clientId, immediateManager, and topManager.

Step 2: Fetch User Balance
	•	Call:

POST /account/get-balances

Request:

{
  "authToken": "{AUTH_TOKEN}",
  "platform": 1,
  "clientId": {CLIENT_ID},
  "username": "{USERNAME}"
}

Response:

{
  "status": 1,
  "message": "Success",
  "balances": [
    {
      "balanceTypeId": "main",
      "currencyId": "USD",
      "balance": 500.75
    }
  ]
}



Step 3: Deposits (Crypto & Fiat)

For Crypto Deposits:
	•	Generate a crypto deposit address:

POST /payments/generate-cryptapi-address

Request:

{
  "authToken": "{AUTH_TOKEN}",
  "platform": 1,
  "clientId": {CLIENT_ID},
  "ticker": "USDT"
}

Response:

{
  "status": 1,
  "message": "Success",
  "address": "0x123456789abcdef"
}


	•	Display the generated crypto wallet address to the user for deposits.

For Fiat Deposits:
	•	Validate available fiat deposit providers:

POST /payments/validation/providers


	•	Initiate a fiat deposit transaction based on user input.

Step 4: Withdrawals
	•	Validate if the user can withdraw:

GET /statistics/transactions-by-client-username


	•	Perform a withdrawal:

POST /payments/withdraw

Request:

{
  "authToken": "{AUTH_TOKEN}",
  "platform": 1,
  "amount": 50.00,
  "currency": 1,
  "destinationCurrency": 1,
  "destinationNetwork": "ETH",
  "address": "0x123456789abcdef",
  "uniqueId": 12345678,
  "clientId": {CLIENT_ID}
}

Response:

{
  "status": 1,
  "message": "Withdrawal successful"
}



Step 5: Fund Transfers (Between Users)

To transfer funds from one user to another within the casino:
	•	Use:

POST /Default/Transfer

Request:

{
  "authToken": "{AUTH_TOKEN}",
  "platform": 1,
  "amount": 100,
  "toAgent": false,
  "currency": "USD",
  "clientId": {TO_CLIENT_ID},
  "username": "{TO_USERNAME}",
  "comment": "Transfer for gaming"
}



Step 6: Fetch Transaction History
	•	Retrieve user betting, deposits, and withdrawals via:

POST /statistics/transactions-by-client-username

Request:

{
  "authToken": "{AUTH_TOKEN}",
  "currency": "USD",
  "username": "{USERNAME}"
}

Response:

{
  "status": 1,
  "message": "Success",
  "statisticsForThePast7Days": {
    "totalDeposit": 200.00,
    "totalBet": 50.00,
    "totalWithdraw": 20.00,
    "canWithdraw": true,
    "amountToBet": 30.00
  }
}



Step 7: Sending User Notifications
	•	Notify users via in-app messaging:

POST /Default/SendMessage

Request:

{
  "authToken": "{AUTH_TOKEN}",
  "platform": 1,
  "username": "{USERNAME}",
  "subject": "Your Deposit was Successful",
  "message": "Your deposit of $100 has been credited to your account."
}

3. Security Considerations
	1.	API Authentication: Use an authToken for all transactions.
	2.	Rate Limiting: Implement request throttling to prevent abuse.
	3.	Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive user data (passwords, transactions).
	4.	Error Handling: Handle API failures with appropriate messages.

⸻

4. Final Integration Architecture
	1.	Frontend (React/Vue/Angular)
	•	Displays balance, transactions, deposit & withdrawal UI.
	•	Calls API endpoints via REST.
	2.	Backend (Node.js, Python, PHP)
	•	Handles authentication, transactions, and balance calculations.
	•	Stores user information securely.
	3.	Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
	•	Stores user profiles, transaction logs, and balances.
	4.	747 API
	•	Connects to the casino system for payments and user management.

5. Example Code Snippets

Fetching Balance (Node.js)

const axios = require("axios");

async function getBalance(authToken, clientId, username) {
    const response = await axios.post("https://api.747casino.com/account/get-balances", {
        authToken,
        platform: 1,
        clientId,
        username
    });
    return response.data;
}

Processing Withdrawals (Python)

import requests

def withdraw_funds(auth_token, client_id, amount, address):
    url = "https://api.747casino.com/payments/withdraw"
    payload = {
        "authToken": auth_token,
        "platform": 1,
        "amount": amount,
        "currency": 1,
        "destinationCurrency": 1,
        "destinationNetwork": "ETH",
        "address": address,
        "uniqueId": 12345678,
        "clientId": client_id
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()
