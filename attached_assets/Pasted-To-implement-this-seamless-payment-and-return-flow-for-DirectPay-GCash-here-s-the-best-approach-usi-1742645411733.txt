To implement this seamless payment and return flow for DirectPay GCash, here’s the best approach using redirects and webhook coordination:

⸻

Overall Flow Breakdown
	1.	User Initiates Payment
	•	User clicks “Deposit with GCash”.
	•	Frontend calls your API which sends a request to DirectPay’s GCash endpoint with:
	•	webhook: your backend endpoint to receive transaction status.
	•	redirectUrl: the page where the user should return after completing payment (e.g. /payment-status?tx_id=ref_XXXX).
	2.	User Redirected to GCash App
	•	DirectPay returns a link like https://payment.infinitipay.co/tx/9168725.
	•	User is redirected to that GCash payment link.
	3.	After Payment – Return via redirectUrl
	•	Once the user completes or cancels the payment, GCash redirects them to the redirectUrl you provided (e.g. /payment-status?tx_id=ref_4e748771b7a37ca4).
	•	This URL opens a page in your app that can automatically check if the transaction was successful.
	4.	Webhook Handles Background Confirmation
	•	Separately, your webhook (e.g. /api/webhook/gcash_sync) is triggered by DirectPay as soon as the payment is successful.
	•	Your webhook should:
	•	Update the transaction status in your database.
	•	Trigger the automatic casino transfer via API if needed.

How to Implement in Your App

1. Frontend Redirect URL Setup

Set this as redirectUrl in your DirectPay request:

https://your-app.com/payment-status?tx_id=ref_4e748771b7a37ca4

2. Thank You Page Logic (/payment-status)

In this page:
	•	Read the tx_id from the URL.
	•	Call your backend (e.g. /api/check-transaction-status?tx_id=...) to fetch the latest status.
	•	If status = success, show a Thank You screen and a button to go back to Dashboard.
	•	If still pending, optionally show a loader and retry for a few seconds.

Sample Logic (Pseudo JavaScript):

// payment-status.js
const tx_id = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("tx_id");

async function checkStatus() {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/check-transaction-status?tx_id=${tx_id}`);
  const data = await res.json();
  if (data.status === "success") {
    window.location.href = `/thank-you?tx_id=${tx_id}`;
  } else {
    setTimeout(checkStatus, 3000); // Retry every 3 seconds
  }
}
checkStatus();

3. Thank You Page (/thank-you)

This shows a message like:
	•	“Your deposit was successful!”
	•	A button: “Go to Dashboard” → /dashboard.

Webhook	Ensure your webhook updates DB and triggers casino transfer
Return page	Poll for status using tx_id, redirect to thank you
Thank You Page	Shows confirmation + Go to Dashboard button
